## Description

This application generates a random password between 8 and 128 characters, allowing for the use of lowercase letter, uppercase letter, numbers, and special characters depending on user input. This allows the user to create a truly random password, making the user much more secure.

This project tested my ability to write functions and make use of conditional statements. I had to learn how to combine arrays based on user input, as well as create a math function to create a password in the appropriate number of characters (also based on user input). This project combined some starter code to listen for the press of the "Generate Password" button, but the functionality of the application was built from there. This was my first fuctional program that I have ever built.

## Usage

Navigate to https://nreece6.github.io/password-generator/ to use this application.

Once you have navigated to the site, press the "Generate Password" button and you will be prompted with questions pretaining to the desired character length of your password, whether or not you would like to use Upper Case letters, Numbers, and Special Characters in your password. The program assumes Lowercase letters will be used. You can refresh the page if you are not happy with the desired results to run the application again.
