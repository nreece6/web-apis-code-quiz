# web-apis-code-quiz

## Description

I built this application to test my trivia knowledge. Before entering the full stack web development bootcamp, every Thursday evening I would go to my local brewery for a Trivia night with friends and family. As I cannot continue to go to Trivia due to my class commitments, I wanted a way to stay engaged.

This quiz is timed. You earn points by correctly answering questions. If you answer all of the questions, or the timer runs out (whichever comes first), the quiz ends and you are able to store your high score. Only the 5 highest scores should be stored.

This project was a huge challenge. This is the most involved JavaScript work I have ever done,  even with the help of guides. I found it easiest to create multiple html files for the different screens I imagined for this application, which I had never done before.

## Usage

Navigate to https://nreece6.github.io/web-apis-code-quiz/ to use this application.

Once you have navigated to the site, you will be greeted with a landing page prompting you to start the quiz or view the high score. Clicking the "Start Quiz" button will bring you to the game.html file where the game is played. Here you will be greeted with a question and possible answers. Clicking on your first answer begins the game, which initiates a timer. Answering questions correctly increases your score. 

Once the timer has run out (or if you manage to answer all possible questions before time runs out), you will be brough to the end screen where you are prompted to enter your username. This will store your name with your score. You can move to the high scores page from the end screen or the landing page to view stored high scores. Only the top 5 scores will be displayed.
